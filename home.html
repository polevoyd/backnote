                <p>
                     <b>Backnote</b> is a company that makes your online notekeeping easier. It was founded in 2018 in Seattle by four Code Fellows students
                    during project week. After many sleepless nights of coding, midnight runs for al pastor tacos and an occasional shot of Stolichnaya,
                    <b>Backnote</b> was launched in August 2018. We devote all our time and effort to making your browsing and notekeeping experience
                    enjoyable and easy. With <b>Backnote</b> you will no longer have to switch between tabs during browsing sessions to make and store notes. Furthermore
                    it's very easy to find your notes back in an ordered fashion on your personal notebook page. Keeping tabs on your
                    browsing notes is a breeze with <b>Backnote</b>.
