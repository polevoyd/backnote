#Backnote Group Agreement
##July 2018

--
Discussion- Keeping everything open, when someone has an idea to share or a thought we agree to let the member speak and share their thoughts with the group. 

Project Roles- Everyone will have a part in the group and will be sharing tasks to build our app. Not one person will be taking control of one aspect of the project. Itâ€™s a group effort. 

Disagreements- When a topic is up for discussion, as stated we agree to let everyone share their thoughts with the group. But when the group has a disagreement on something we still honor the member(s) to speak their opinion on the topic. However we agree as a group that we all need to like the suggestion or idea before we can move on. 
COMMUNICATION is key to a successful group. 

*If it gets REALLY out of hand, we will bring in a third party to mitigate and de-escalate the issue.
